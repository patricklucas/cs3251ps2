For all parts, the server component is the receiver of the file and must be running before starting the corresponding client component.

All executables use stdin and stdout: the server will output to stdout the bytes sent by the client, which reads from stdin.

Build all executables with `make' from the top level directory.

Examples:

    ./part1_server > outfile &
    cat infile | ./part1_client

(outfile now contains the same content as infile)

    ./part2_server > outfile &
    cat infile | ./part2_client

(outfile now contains the same content as infile)

    ./part3_server > outfile &
    cat infile | ./part3_client

(outfile now contains the same content as infile)

Per the assignment, the part1_* executables are TCP-based, and the part2_* executables are UDP-based. The part3_* exectuables are very similar to the part1_* ones, however part3_client is a Python script.
